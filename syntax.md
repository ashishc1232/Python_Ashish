# Python Syntax 

## 1. Writing Your First Python Code

```python
print("Hello, world!")
````

* `print()` is used to show output.
* Text is written in quotes.

## 2. Variables

You can store values using variables.

```python
name = "Govind"
age = 20
```

* No need to declare type.
* Use `=` to assign a value.

## 3. Comments

Comments help explain code. Python ignores them.

```python
# This is a comment
```

## 4. Indentation (Very Important)

Python uses **indentation** to define blocks.

Wrong:

```python
if True:
print("Yes")
```

Correct:

```python
if True:
    print("Yes")
```

* Use 4 spaces (or a tab).
* No `{}` or `;` needed like in other languages.

## 5. Simple Input and Output

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)
```

* `input()` takes user input (always as a string).
* `print()` shows output.

## What to Learn Next

Once you're comfortable with the above, move on to:

* Conditions (`if`, `else`)
* Loops (`for`, `while`)
* Data types (`int`, `str`, `list`)
* Functions (`def`)
